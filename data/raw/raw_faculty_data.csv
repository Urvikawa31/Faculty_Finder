I am interested in the phenomenological tradition and its wider ramifications in the 20th century as Hermeneutics et al, particularly with reference to phenomenology’s approach to questions in metaphysics. My general research focus is organized around questions pertaining, broadly speaking, to the ontology of tradition in view of its complicated relation to the notion history. Currently I am interested in unraveling the relations between Phenomenology and Hermeneutics. As a trained scholar in literature (Modernism), I bring to bear my literary training on closely reading canonical philosophical texts of the Western tradition. Students interested in working at the intersection between literature and philosophy are encouraged to contact me.</p>

For my PhD project, I studied a range of commercial-aesthetic practices of cinema in Kerala between the late 1940s and the mid 1960s, by examining their relationship to the political imaginaries that they gave expressions to. My current research attempts to make contributions to the studies on contemporary transformations in media cultures across the globe, especially with the peaking of digital media cultures, by generating cultural histories of the shifts in practices of media forms in india post 1990s. Media Theory, Cultural Studies, and Film Studies are my main areas of interest. I have taught courses in Media Research Methods, Introduction to Cinema, History of Media, Media Laws and Ethics, Writing for Print Media and Communication Theories.</p>

Her doctoral dissertation, Transport in India: A Tale of Three Cities (c. 1900-c.1960), examines how modern transport such as cars, buses, trams interact with older modes of technology such as bullock carts, tongas and rickshaws. There are many axes along which this interaction can be plotted. Some of these are congestion, town planning and the changing nature of the streets and roads. She has also completed her Masters and MPhil degree in Modern Indian History from Jawaharlal Nehru University. She is the recipient of the 2019-2020 Fulbright Nehru Doctoral Research Fellowship. As a Fulbright Nehru Doctoral researcher, she was affiliated with the Centre for the History and Ethics of Public Health at Columbia University, New York City. Her role as archives associate at the Archives of Contemporary India, Ashoka University enabled her to understand the significance of archival preservation which she wishes to share with students and the teaching community.</p>

She holds a Master of Philosophy degree in Indian Diaspora from the University of Hyderabad, India. Her study investigated the social aspect of remittances and the patterns of transnational engagement through investment in property by the Telugu Diaspora. She obtained her master’s degree in Society and Culture from Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar. Her thesis analysed the transnational networks maintained by the Gujarati diaspora from the United Kingdom.</p>

With some bright ex-students of DA-IICT, Prof. Dasgupta built RAx (https://raxter.io) - an AI-powered online assistant for making literature-review faster and more enriching for young researchers.</p>
<p>Coming back from his entrepreneurial stint, Prof. Dasgupta is currently actively engaged in the <em><strong>analysis of less explored but important aspects of ""intelligence"" </strong></em>in LLMs, such as their personalization capabilities, and also <em><strong>designing personalized models that are a lot smaller and more eco-friendly</strong></em> than contemporary LLMs. In his pastime, Prof. Dasgupta loves to cook and debate with students.

He taught English Literature at a liberal arts college for 32 years before opting for early retirement in 2021. He was a Fellow at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla (2008-2010), and Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust (May-June 2017); and a Visiting Professor at the School of Arts and Sciences, Ahmedabad University (2018). Interested in the history of ideas with a particular focus on nineteenth and twentieth-century India, Mukherji specialises in Intellectual history, with a particular focus on capacious concepts, the imagining of modern India, Vivekananda, Tagore, Gandhi, Post Colonialism, and the Mahabharata. His books, published internationally, have been credited with generous reviews by some of the leading experts in the field. He served as the Convener of the International Seminar on “Exploring NonViolence” organised at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla, from October 20-22, 2008; the International Seminar on “The Home and the World: Rabindranath Tagore” sponsored by Ministry of Culture, Government of India, and organised at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla, during November 14-16, 2011, the Joint Coordinator of the Summer School on “Exploring Agency in the Mahabharata: Ethical, Political and Dharmic” organised at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla, during September 17-30, 2012, and the Coordinator of the Winter School on “Life and Thought of Gandhi” organised at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla, from December 1-15, 2016.</p>

","<h4><strong>Current Research:</strong></h4>
<p>Dr. Maheshwari works in the field of design, analysis, and implementation of sequential, parallel, and external memory algorithms for problems arising in Computational Geometry, Graph Theory, and Data Science. Recently, he has been looking into problems related to geometric graphs, geometric location analysis and shortest path problems. His research work in geometric graphs is centred around the theme of establishing graph theoretic and geometric properties of the underlying spatial configuration, and use them to design efficient algorithmic solutions. The graph theoretic properties of interests are connectivity, bi-connectivity, spanning properties, diameter, planarity, perfect and bottleneck matchings, Hamiltonian cycle, separators, independent sets, vertex and edge colourings. The geometric graphs of particular interest are spanners, unit-disk graphs, plane graphs, proximity graphs, Delaunay triangulations and its variants. In geometric location analysis, he studies various algorithm design questions related to finding the best location to place facilities. In geometric path problems, he looks at variants and applications of shortest path problems in two and three-dimensions. The above three areas are interrelated. Often a geometric problem is transformed into a graph problem, and by exploiting the geometric structure a faster algorithm for the graph problem is obtained. Geometric spanners are main ingredients used in designing efficient algorithms for geometric path problems. This, in turn, requires the construction of spanners having useful structural properties. Matching in geometric graphs helps in understanding and discovering combinatorial and geometric structures inherent in these graphs. In location analysis problems, the underlying geometric structure with graph-theoretic techniques is exploited to design faster algorithms.</p>
